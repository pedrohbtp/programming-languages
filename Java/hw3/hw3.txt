On file SwapTest. There might be an infinite loop
if state.swap(a, b) keeps returning false.
It returns false when value on position a of the array is less or equal to zero
or when value on position b of the array is greater or equal to the maximum
value allowed. (normally 127 unless specified).

The infinite loop happens if all elements are equal to 0 or equal to maxvalue.
That only happens if there are race conditions. Because if there are not,
then the sum should be constant.
For instance, even for the synchronized class with only one thread, we might still
fall into an infinite loop if we do the following:
java UnsafeMemory Synchronized 1 10000 6 0 0 0 0

The infinite loop is because all the values in the array are equal to 0.
Then it is not possible to decrement any of them. The swap will always fail and 
it will run forever.


BetterSorry:
When comparing to see if less than zero or greater than maxvalue,
returns true so the progress does not stop.
